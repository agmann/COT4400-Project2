This project was completed by Jack Burger, Austin Mann, and Johnathan Valencia. 

This is a Java application, and thus it will require having Java installed on the target system. For best results, have the latest jdk installed on your machine and ensure that it supports compilation and running from the terminal on linux. 
The source and class files are contained in the root directory (the same one as this readme). To compile on a linux system, type the following command in an open terminal window when in the root directory of the project:

  javac *.java
  
This will compile all of the source files. Then run the folowing command:

  java ProjectMain
  
This will execute the main method. Once it has terminated, the output file "output.txt" will contain the results based on the input data located in "input.txt." 
If exceptions are thrown, ensure that the input.txt file is present in the root directory.
